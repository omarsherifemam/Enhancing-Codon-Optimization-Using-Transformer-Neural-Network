# Protein-to-DNA Sequence Optimization Tool

## Overview
This repository provides a tool for optimizing DNA sequences based on protein inputs. The program leverages machine learning models, such as Transformers, and bioinformatics libraries to process and optimize protein sequences. Additionally, a GUI is included for user-friendly interaction.

## Features
- **Protein to DNA Sequence Optimization**: Converts protein sequences into optimized DNA sequences using advanced models.
- **Mutation Introduction**: Adds realistic mutations to sequences for enhanced variability.
- **Embeddings with ESM-2**: Extracts protein embeddings using Facebook's ESM-2 model.
- **Transformer-Based Decoder**: Implements a Transformer-based architecture for sequence generation.
- **Interactive GUI**: Includes a graphical interface for input and output operations.
